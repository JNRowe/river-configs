Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

..
    Ask them, and perhaps they'll become frequent enough to be added here ;)

This can't *possibly* be worth it
---------------------------------

Okay, thanks for pointing that out.

.. _supported-versions:

How do you decide what version of $tool you support?
----------------------------------------------------

Right now, it is :doc:`whatever version I've bothered to package
<sections/river/software_versions>`.  When I have a spare minute or find a bug,
I'll update the sources and re-package.

In the ideal case I'll simply defer to Debian_, but that'll have to wait until
the software is actually available in Debian.

Isn't it really difficult to edit ``zsh`` in ``reST``?
------------------------------------------------------

It could be, but this is one of the perfect use cases for the NrrwRgn_ plugin.
You can use it to open sections of a file in a different window, and that window
can have its own options configured including the filetype.

I can't state enough how useful this plugin can be.  It makes writing and
working with files with mixed content, such as templates, a smooth experience.

What is the schedule for giving new in-person talks on this?
------------------------------------------------------------

Frankly, I have no idea.  I *really* enjoy presenting, so I do it whenever I can
find an excuse.  However, I have none scheduled right now.

In the meantime should you have questions feel free to ask by mail_. I
genuinely do enjoy replying to them, as I often learn something new along the
way.

.. tip::

    **Co-workers**: You can find recordings of old sessions on µfilm under
    ``JNRowe/river``, and you should feel free to ask |river| questions by the
    other methods in my contact details too!
