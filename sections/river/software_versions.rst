.. note::

    These are the base versions from upstream, there may be local additions
    exposed in the installation packages.  However, they will *not* introduce
    breaking changes.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#s1] I've added some largely uninteresting local changes from upstream, I'm
         purposely not changing anything in the hope I can smoothly transition
         to an official Debian package at some point.

.. [#s2] Beyond packaging changes there are only light hacks to use `Nerd
         Fonts`_ for icons.
