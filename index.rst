.. epigraph::

   So, imagine your workmate has created a new tool that *requires* Wayland…

This is my personal |river| configuration that is shared among hosts.  Maybe
they’re useful to you too, or — better yet — you’ll spot *and* fix a bug!

.. note::

    I’m writing this for myself as a |WIP| notebook.  Expect foolish — or even
    downright ignorant — errors and omissions.  Feel free to `drop me a note`_
    for clarifications or to fix my invalid assumptions.

This is in a very early state; basically the result of needing to get up and
running quickly, without breaking my workflow too much.  I haven’t decided on a
lot of things yet, so don’t expect this to work for you *or* remain as-is for
long.
